# Seattle-Airbnb-Shiny-App
Shiny App created from the Seattle Airbnb data to visualize various components incorporated into your Airbnb stay. 
### Authors: Allie Baker, Jaime Cassell, and Nikunja Shrestha 

Created as a result of Chase Romano's Visual Analytics course in the Data Science and Business Analytics master's program at the University of North Carolina Charlotte, this Shiny application investigates Seattle Airbnb listings (data web-scraped in 2016).
